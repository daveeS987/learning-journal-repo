## Notes

Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file. 
Local version control systems were stored on hard disk
Centralized Version control systems(CVCS) was using servers to store changes
Distributed Version Control systems(DVCS) was a step up from CVCS which allowed clients to create mirrored repositories. 

Git is a DVCS that stores snapshots of your files. A commit is a changed version. 

Files in get can reside in three main states: 
committed - data is stored in a local database
modified - file has been changed but not commited to database
staged - flagged a file's changed version to be commited in the next snapshot
