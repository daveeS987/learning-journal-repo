## Computer Architecture and Logic Notes

- 4 things common to all computers - they need to be able to take input, store it, process it, and produce output
- wires and circuits call all information inside a computer
- bit is the smallest information a computer can store. electric switch on or off, 0 or 1, true or false
- binary is used to represent numbers, letters, color, images, video, and audio 
- All input or output is information that is represented by on or off electrical signals
- Computers have circuits that perform multiple logic operations
- Circuits take multiple electrical signals and combine them to get different results
- input devices takes physical input and converts to binary
- CPU processes the binary information using instructions from memory and stores in memory. Information is then sent to output device
- CPU is the master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer
- Operating system is the master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer
