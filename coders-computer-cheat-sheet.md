#### Difference Between Text Editors and IDE's

A text editor edits text, manages it, and manages files. 
An IDE(Integrated Development Environment) is a suite of differetn software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file
manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.


## The Command Line

pwd - print working directory  
ls : list  

ls [options][locations] Square brackets means they're optional
ls - l: long listing  
ls /etc: When we do this it tells ls not to list our current directory but instead to list that directories contents.  
ls -l /etc: We ran ls with both a command line option and argument. As such it did a long listing of the directory /etc.  

#### Paths
Absolute and Relative

Absolute paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to the root directory. You can identify them easily as they always begin with a forward slash ( / )

Relative paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to where we currently are in the system. They will not begin with a slash.

- ~ (tilde) - This is a shortcut for your home directory. eg, if your home directory is /home/ryan then you could refer to the directory Documents with the path /home/ryan/Documents or ~/Documents
- . (dot) - This is a reference to your current directory. eg in the example above we referred to Documents on line 4 with a relative path. It could also be written as ./Documents (Normally this extra bit is not required but in later sections we will see where it comes in handy).
- .. (dotdot)- This is a reference to the parent directory. You can use this several times in a path to keep going up the hierarchy. eg if you were in the path /home/ryan you could run the command ls ../../ and this would do a listing of the root directory.
