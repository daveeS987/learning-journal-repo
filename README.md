Hi my name is Davee. I've served in the US Army as an infantryman. After the military I spent some time working in the Middle East as a security contractor. I've also owned a small business. Im currently trying to transition careers and I'm very excited about what's to come. 

### Growth Mindset

*Growth mindset* is the belief that you can learn and pick up new skills regardless of any limitations you believe you have.   

#### Reminders to stay in a Growth Mindset
1. If I'm stuck on something, dont get frustrated and understand that I don't understand it **yet**. With more time, the knowledge and skill will come. 
2. Everyone is an amateur or clueless at some point in their life. No one starts out as an expert.
3. If something doesn't seem to be working, try a different strategy or approach. Success will come.
