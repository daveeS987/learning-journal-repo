## Operators and Loops

###Comparison Operators

```
== : is equal to
=== : strict equal to
!= : is not equal to
!== : strict not equal to
> : greater than
>= : greater than or equal to
< : less than
<= : less than or equal to
```

- Strict equals will compare two values and data type. Equal will only compare value

###Logical Operators

- Logical operators will let you compare the results of more than one comparison operator

### Loops

- Use for loop if you need to run a code a specific number of times
- Use while loop if you dont know how many times the code needs to run
- For loop will consist of an initialization, condition, and update.
